# Compiled .NET Evidence Foundation Implementation State

Status: Task 8 exact source-to-metadata reconciliation implemented and locally accepted; PR creation and exact-head ACK review pending

Branch: `codex/source-metadata-reconciliation`

Base: `origin/dev` at `532fccfb0a7588ab64397f672ca6a8dddef8d083`

Tracking: #759, #766, #767, #768, #769

Task 8 implementation commits: `010502ef` (`feat: reconcile exact source and
metadata identities`) and `55fefd48` (`test: prove source metadata
reconciliation matrix`).

## Scope decision

The first implementation slice ends at bounded managed-input inventory,
assembly/module/type/member metadata identity, provenance/coverage gaps,
cross-reader agreement, and small public C#/VB.NET/F# fixtures. Source and
compiled facts remain separate in this slice. It does not begin
source-to-metadata reconciliation, broad IL traversal, rewrite analysis, PDB
reconciliation, historical corpus execution, or C++/CLI support.

## Evidence decisions

- Mono.Cecil supplements Roslyn and syntax fallback; it replaces neither.
- Compiled metadata is Tier2 structural evidence unless a future documented
  rule justifies a different tier. Reader/provenance/availability gaps are
  Tier4 unknown.
- Source, metadata, PDB, IL, and rewritten identities stay separate.
- Every compiled fact retains the ordinary scan repository/commit identity,
  while optional receipt-validated binary-source/build provenance uses
  separate fields and may remain absent for an unbound input.
- Manifest-level compiled-input provenance is unconditional, including when no
  assembly is admitted. Its local bounded-input digest participates in `scanId`
  before fact IDs are derived; a distinct shareable summary binds its
  privacy-projected digest into its own artifact identity.
- Private compiled facts/indexes remain local-only in the first slice; a
  shareable derivative must be a distinct non-`CodeFact` privacy-projected
  summary rather than leaking or substituting required scan identity fields.
- Metadata-only facts use a safe assembly locator, `1..1` non-source sentinel,
  and versioned token-bearing properties. Ambient dependency resolution is
  forbidden; only declared, admitted, hashed dependencies may be read.
- Metadata tokens are module-local locations. MVID, path, timestamp, and display
  string alone cannot prove source identity or freshness.
- Bounded-input hashing uses a canonical pre-digest payload that excludes the
  digest and all downstream identities derived from it; the computed digest is
  attached before scan/fact IDs are derived.
- Normalized assembly/type/member/signature identities length-prefix every
  free-text component, preserving delimiters, the empty/global namespace, and
  nested declaring chains without ambiguous concatenation.
- Missing, stale, ambiguous, unbound, or mismatched inputs reduce compiled
  coverage and never erase or upgrade source-derived evidence. Timestamps alone
  do not establish staleness.
- Correctness, fixtures, and validation contracts are open-core. Managed
  private Windows execution is outside this implementation slice.

## Historical inputs

- PR #770 at the base commit is the current Web Forms terminal-reachability
  authority.
- The two retained VB/Web Forms investigation worktrees are preserved and are
  inventoried in
  `docs/history/WEBFORMS_VB_INVESTIGATION_BRANCHES_2026-09-19.md`. They will not
  be merged wholesale.
- The `dotnetperf` assessment is pinned to
  `db8c3359badfec620ccdc6df062b1756ef9607f8`. Its strongest dimensions are
  exception-region/branch rewriting and Cecil method-body behavior; its test
  count is not broad ECMA conformance and it lacks the required modern
  cross-language matrix.

## Validation state

Tasks 1-6 are implemented. The lane uses pinned Mono.Cecil `0.11.6` with
deferred reading and a resolver that rejects ambient resolution, then
independently compares normalized rows from `System.Reflection.Metadata`.
Disputed rows are withheld. The CLI accepts explicit primary, dependency, and
binding-receipt inputs plus validated admission limits; the manifest, `scanId`,
facts, SQLite index, Markdown report, and execution receipt retain the bounded
contract without exposing raw absolute paths.

The public portable fixture matrix lives under
`samples/compiled-dotnet-evidence/` and covers C#, VB.NET, and F#. Focused tests
exercise exact CLR identities, duplicate and unresolved dependencies,
provenance states, malformed/native/missing/over-budget inputs, reader
disagreement, deterministic bytes, privacy, all five scan artifacts, and
unchanged source evidence. Review hardening also covers iterative deeply nested
type inventory, filesystem-aware input and receipt-path deduplication, bounded
projection of overlong input locators, and explicit rejection of metadata-bearing
secondary modules. It also pins top-level receipt binding counts, rejects text
limits too small for a complete projected digest, converts excessive
metadata-signature nesting into an explicit partial-coverage gap, and keeps
compiled coverage separate from the source `analysisLevel`. Artifact overflow
retains only the configured number of per-input rows plus a deterministic
omitted-count/digest commitment. The local distribution workflow runs the same
focused tests on Windows, Ubuntu, and macOS.

Local macOS validation on 2026-09-20:

- `dotnet build src/dotnet/TraceMap.sln --no-restore`: passed with zero warnings
  and zero errors.
- `dotnet test src/dotnet/TraceMap.sln --no-restore`: 1,982 passed,
  zero failed, zero skipped.
- focused `ManagedMetadataExtractorTests`: 22 passed, zero failed.
- two explicit admitted compiled-input CLI scans: 107 facts each, including 80
  compiled-rule facts; byte-identical `facts.ndjson`; all five required
  artifacts present; both output directories passed
  `scripts/validate-adapter-artifacts.py`; neither output contained a local
  absolute path.
- `scripts/check-private-paths.sh`: passed.
- `node scripts/kiro-review.mjs --self-test`: passed; implementation prompt
  dry-run completed with `Coverage: NotRun` as expected because it did not
  invoke the external Kiro reviewer.
- `git diff --check`: passed.

Task 7 is complete. Earlier PR #772 heads passed the portable matrix and package
smoke on Windows, Ubuntu, and macOS plus the .NET adapter, combined-adapter, and
private-path jobs. PR #772 was merged into `dev` as
`532fccfb0a7588ab64397f672ca6a8dddef8d083` on 2026-09-20. No reviewer was
manually retagged during the completed first-slice review loop.

Portable Windows success does not prove Windows PDB, legacy .NET Framework or
Web Forms build behavior, ILAsm/ILDAsm parity, the historical `dotnetperf`
corpus, or C++/CLI feasibility. The following remain deferred without implied
support: source-to-metadata reconciliation, PDB identity, operand-aware IL,
rewriting, legacy build execution, the historical corpus, and C++/CLI.

The later exact-head review added regression coverage for receipt-only scans
and oversized assembly-reference identities. Receipt-only activation now emits
the rule-backed `NoManagedInputDeclared` gap, and assembly-reference plus
dependency-resolution strings honor the configured compiled text limit.

## Task 8 exact source-to-metadata reconciliation

`dotnet.compiled.source-identity.v1` is active. When the compiled lane is
explicitly requested, the C# and Visual Basic semantic adapters retain internal
compiler-resolved source declaration identities without changing their normal
source facts. The reconciler emits one Tier1 edge only for one complete exact
metadata identity candidate backed by a validated `bound` receipt. Each edge
retains both endpoint identities, source and compiled fact IDs, rule and
extractor versions, bounded-input and generator digests, receipt-binding digest,
compiled provenance state, relationship proof, and the rule limitation.

Zero and multiple candidates, incomplete source identities, optional-parameter
state disagreement, and unacceptable compiled provenance remain Tier4 gaps
with no edge. Display strings, simple names, arity, path proximity, timestamps,
and metadata tokens never select a candidate. Compiler-generated declarations
remain separate except for Roslyn's specific associated property/event accessor
relationship. F# compiled identities remain available, but its `.fsproj` lane
emits `SourceMetadataReconciliationUnsupportedLanguage` and zero guessed joins.
Compiled coverage remains independent from source `analysisLevel`.

The v2 public fixture contract records stable reconciliation case IDs, exact
source and metadata identities, expected rule/tier/outcome/gaps, and non-claims.
The matrix covers namespaces, nested/generic declarations, complete overload
signatures, constructors, properties/indexers, events/accessors, C# ref and VB
ByRef shapes, optional parameters, explicit interfaces where representable,
same-looking cross-assembly/language declarations, exact zero candidates, exact
multiple candidates, unbound inputs, and the F# unsupported source lane.

Local macOS Task 8 validation on 2026-09-20:

- focused `SourceMetadataReconciliationTests`: 7 passed, zero failed, zero
  skipped;
- existing `ManagedMetadataExtractorTests`: 22 passed, zero failed, zero
  skipped;
- `dotnet build src/dotnet/TraceMap.sln --no-restore`: passed with zero warnings
  and zero errors;
- `dotnet test src/dotnet/TraceMap.sln --no-restore`: 1,989 passed, zero failed,
  zero skipped;
- two bound C# fixture CLI scans: 267 facts each, 30 exact reconciliation edges,
  and three explicit incomplete source-identity gaps; `facts.ndjson`, report,
  reconciliation manifest summary, and normalized SQLite fact rows matched;
  both output directories contained all five required artifacts and passed
  `scripts/validate-adapter-artifacts.py`;
- `scripts/check-private-paths.sh`: passed;
- `node scripts/kiro-review.mjs --self-test`: passed; and
- `git diff --check`: passed.

The three retained C# gaps are the existing unmanaged function-pointer shapes;
compiled identities remain available, but source reconciliation intentionally
fails closed as `SourceFunctionPointerIdentityUnsupported` until a separately
documented complete Roslyn custom-calling-convention identity contract exists.
Task 8 makes no PDB/sequence-point, IL body/call, rewrite, `dotnetperf`/private
corpus, legacy Framework/Web Forms, or C++/CLI claim. Tasks 9-11 remain
deferred. Operational `scannedAt` and receipt durations remain wall-clock
diagnostics rather than deterministic evidence identifiers; deterministic
evidence payloads and normalized artifact content were compared instead.
